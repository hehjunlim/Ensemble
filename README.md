## AI Integration Details

The app integrates with Anthropic's Claude API to provide intelligent fashion advice:

1. **Outfit Analysis**: When a user submits an outfit for a specific occasion, the app sends this information to the Claude API along with a custom system prompt.

2. **Structured Response**: Claude analyzes the outfit and returns a structured response that includes:
   - A suitability score (1-10)
   - Aspects of the outfit that work well
   - Suggestions for improvements
   - Specific recommendations for accessories or alternatives

3. **Image Processing**: When users upload photos, the app converts these to base64 and includes them in the API request, allowing Claude to analyze the visual aspects of the outfit.
